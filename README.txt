This website template is a part of an IEEE backed project called 'Automated Online Bloodbank Database Management Project'. It differs from presently existing bloodbank projects in the aspect that it will provide realtime autorouting funtionality for a prospective recipient to the most eligible donor in the DB (based on many criteria). We are planning to implement that functionality using Asterisk, an OSS for call directing, management, IVR etc.
